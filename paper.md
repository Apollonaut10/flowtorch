# Summary

Package summary.

# Statement of need

`flowTorch` is the successor of xROM [@semaan2020]. 

# Example

You can also use plain \LaTeX for equations
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fourier}
\hat f(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{i\omega x} dx
\end{equation}
and refer to \autoref{eq:fourier} from text.

# Figures

Figure sizes can be customized by adding an optional second parameter:
![The FOR logo.\label{fig:logo}](media/for2895_logo.png){ width=80% }
The figure above show \autoref{fig:logo} shows the official FOR logo.
